## ‚ùóÔ∏èExcuting the code locally
Executing the back-end

You need to have Java and Maven installed and configured locally.

Open the crud-spring project in your favorite IDE as a Maven project and execute it as Spring Boot application.
Executing the front-end

You need to have Node.js / NPM installed locally.

   ## Install all the required depencencies:

npm install

   ## Execute the project:

npm run start

This command will run the Angular project with a proxy to the Java server, without requiring CORS.

Open your browser and access http://localhost:4200 (Angular default port).
